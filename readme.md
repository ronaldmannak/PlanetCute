# Danc's CutePlanet Game Prototyping Vector Tiles

[Daniel Cook](https://plus.google.com/+DanielCookGameDesign/posts) released a set of very useful prototyping game tiles on [Lost Garden](http://www.lostgarden.com/2007/05/dancs-miraculously-flexible-game.html) back in 2007 as PNG files and the (to me) obscure XAML vector format.

# Work in Progress
For prototyping on retina displays it makes sense to use the vector files instead of the (by today's standards) low resolution original PNG files.

This repository contains the orignal vector art converted to SVG, [Sketch 3.0](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/) and [Affinity Design](https://affinity.serif.com) using [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/en/), the only Mac application I could find that supports XAML. 

The import isn't perfect. The Sketch file is missing some gradients, the positioning of some elements are off in Affinity and the colors in both files are different. My goal is to fix these issues over time.


Happy prototyping!
